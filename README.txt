The calcuator that I made is geared towards content creators wanting to calculate their ROI over their careers.
I included a bonus Youtube comparison calculator that compares the user views with another Youtuber. I have yet to figure out the bug, but it seems like the API favors Youtubers with high views as I was not able to fetch lower-tiered youtubers' view counts during my test runs.
Some channels that worked are TTfue, pewdiepie, MrBeast
